Transaction information:
Dates/times.  Currently stored as unixish times.  This may change to
something capable of storing resolution, and expressing times without
knowlage of TZ.

bank_date      -- when the transaction was submitted to the bank
effective_date -- when the transactoin deducted/added to the balence of the
	       account
sale_date      -- when the transaction acctualy occoured

Currency amounts.  Currently stored as simple numbers.  This should change
to something capable of expressing an amount, with decimal resolution, along
with the currency it is in, and possibly currency conversion rates.

amount	    -- the amount which has been/will be deducted from your acocunt
base_amount -- the amount the vendor billed for.  This does not include
	       fees, and may be in a different currency from the amount.
	       (NB/FIXME: This description is inaccurate for things like ATMs) 
fees	    -- This is the difference between the amount and the base_amount.
(exchange_rate) -- fixme: base_amount should be cool enough to include this?

comments -- 
     arrayref of arbitrary data.  This is what the grok functions operate
     on.  Depending on local norms, this is often in a prescribed format --
     for example, this should be the Verwendungsweck for German accounts.
     
     Note the "arrayref of" -- this should be in 27-character chunks, for
     German accounts.

ccard_number, ccard_type -- specifies what credit card was used.  This
	      should be generalized, at least in name (what about EC cards, debit cards),
	      and probably stored as an agragate.
ccard_type -- "Electronic Cash", "VISA"

infourl -- internal.
groked -- specifies if a "grok" function has added to the available data.
country -- specifies the country of origin of the transaction.  FIXME, this
	should be used to determine the currency of the base amount.

info1, info2 -- random text extracted from VISA transactions???

MiniMal style:
Tengleman uses a partal minimal style, with 
'POZ9124966[56789] DD.MM HH.MM ME0 VIELEN DANK' in the misc2 field, but no
